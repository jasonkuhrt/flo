# Project CLAUDE.md

## CRITICAL: Context-Specific Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: If a file named `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` exists in this project, read it immediately and follow its instructions. This file contains context-specific information for the current work (e.g., GitHub issue details, PR feedback, etc.).

The `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` file:
- Takes precedence over this file when there are conflicts
- Contains temporary, work-specific context
- Is gitignored and regenerated by `flo` for each issue/worktree
- Should be treated as the primary source of context for the current task
