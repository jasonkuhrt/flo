(B[m
  Safely removes a worktree by branch name, issue number, or worktree directory name.
  Calculates the path automatically and uses Git to properly
  delete it. Always prefer this over 'rm -rf' to keep Git
  state clean.

  When called without arguments, interactively removes the current worktree (if pwd is a worktree).

  When given an issue number, finds the worktree created with
  'flo <issue-number>' and removes it.
